iPhone App Settings and Permissions
-----------------------------------

When installing the Ok Alone app we always recommend accepting the default permissions and settings to get the best performance and monitoring.

Note: After changing any settings please restart the app and any shifts. If the settings are still not updating please re-install the app and accept the default permissions.

Here are the settings and permissions we recommend:

App Location Monitoring:
For accurate location monitoring, we recommend you choose the GPS Normal setting.
With this setting, the phone will use GPS to provide an accurate location in case of emergency while battery usage is still minimised.


iPhone App Settings:
We recommend you allow the app the following settings. To check these settings on your phone go to Settings >> Ok Alone

Main App Settings:
On the Ok Alone settings page, you should have these settings.
-Location: Always
-Mobile Data: On
-Background App Refresh: On

Notification Settings: We recommend you choose these notification settings

Location Settings: For an accurate location – the location permissions should be set to Always and Precise Location should be on.
This allows the app to update your location when it is in background mode – important in case you need assistance at any time during your shift.
